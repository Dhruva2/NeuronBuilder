# NeuronBuilder

This is a quick package for building small networks of detailed, conductance-based neurons out of ion channels and synapses. The idea is that it's easy to use this template and add your own ion channels /synapses , with your choice of dynamics. 

Issue:

I need to figure out what the correct units are for the synaptic conductances...I haven't been careful with units. As of now, the code for building neurons and connecting/simulating works, but I haven't got parameters that recreate the triphasic bursting behaviour of the STG neuron.
